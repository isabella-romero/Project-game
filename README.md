# Project-game (Who let the chicken out?) 
Our group will work together to implement the following game for project one. The user will attempt to reach the other side of the screen in order to complete the level. The user is given a single try to complete each level. The computer will "send" objects into the users path, if the user hits an object they must restart, once the allotted amount of attempts have been used up, the user has lost the game and must re-start. The levels will 
get consistently harder to complete, as the computer will send more and more objects into the users path, traveling at various speeds. The game will store the users scores from each attempt and display them on the leaderboard. 
The highest of all of the scores will be considered the "high score".

game premis: "who let the chicken out" is a game in which the user i.e the chicken attempts to escape the coop. In order to accomplish this the user must make it past the farmer, the fox and the farmers wife. 
If the user is cannot successfully reach the safezone at the other end of the field, the user loses and is put back in the coop. If the user reaches the endzone successfully they then go onto the next level of the challenge. 

Stage one 

1. It is done when on the starting page there there is a JS moodles for the user to input their username.
    - [ ] using JavaScript create a function that allows the user to input their username
    - [ ] limit amount of characters they can use
    - [ ] if no characters are entered prompt the user with "invalid entry, try again"
    - [ ] create an object that stores the information that the user has entered 
2. (tailwind instead of css) It is done when there is a css sheet that styles the container, giving it a background, a circle (the user) and squares (objects in the way). 
   - [ ] create a stylesheet in css that contains the following:
   - [ ] a large container/ box in which the game is limited to that is center of the screen, contains a different color from both the user, and the objects
   - [ ] a circle that is a different color than the background and objects
   - [ ] three squares that are a different color than the background and the user
3. It is done when the JavaScript allows the user to move the circle in a straight line and left and right in the game container, and there are three objects that move horizontally across the screen.
5. It is done when there is a header at the top of the game denoting the name of the game and what level the user is on. 

Stage two 

1. it is done when there is a prompt explaining how the game works, and the user can click through the steps
2. it is done when there is a button for the user to click to input their username
3. it is done when the user "loses an attempt" for coming in contact with one of the objects 
4. it is done when there are at least 2 levels for the user to complete
5. it is done when there are 3 stationary obstacles on level 2 that the user must go around. 
6. it is done when the computer can log each score and determine the highest score.

Stage three 

1. it is done when there is a css sheet that formats the background of the game
2. it is done when there is an avatar that represents the user
3. it is done when there are cars that represent the obstacles on level one
4. it is done when there are stationary potholes that represent obstacles for the user to navigate on level 2 
5. it is done when on the left side of the screen there is a leaderboard that shows the previous scores


Bonus: 

- [ ] Immitate temple run's path that goes on infinitely.
- [ ] the user gets multiple attempts to complete each level
