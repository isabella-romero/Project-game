# Project-game (Who let the chicken out?) 
Our group will work together to implement the following game for project one. The user will attempt to reach the other side of the screen in order to complete the level. The user is given a single try to complete each level. The computer will "send" objects into the users path, if the user hits an object they must restart, once the allotted amount of attempts have been used up, the user has lost the game and must re-start. The game will store the users scores from each attempt and display them on the leaderboard unil the user "loses". 

Game premis: "who let the chicken out" is a game in which the user i.e the chicken attempts to escape the coop. In order to accomplish this the chicken must cross the road without hitting the cars. 
If the user is cannot successfully reach the safezone at the other end of the field, the user loses and is put back in the coop. If the user reaches the endzone successfully their score is recorded and they can try again. 

Stage one 

1. It is done when at the top of the page there is a header that contains the name of the game and a footer that contains design credit. 
    - [ ] using CSS create a header with text that shares the title of the game
    - [ ] using css create a footer that spans the base of the screen
  
2. It is done when there is a css sheet that styles the container, giving it a background, a circle (the user) and         squares (objects in the way). 
   - [ ] create a stylesheet in css that contains the following:
       - [ ] a large container/ box in which the game is limited to that is center of the screen

3. It is done when there are Keyframes in the CSS that control the obstacles
  - [ ] Keyframe that controls the movement of the cars
  - [ ] Keyframe that controls the movement of the cars in reverse

4. It is done when the items within the screen can be resized and the content will match
   
5. It is done when the JavaScript allows the user to move the circle in a straight line and left and right in the game container, and there are three objects that move horizontally across the screen.
   
6. It is done when there is an alert when the user crashes into the obstacle.
     - [ ] Use the alert function in JS to create a message to the user letting them know the game will restart                 because they were hit by the car.
