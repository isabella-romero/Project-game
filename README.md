# Project-game (Who let the chicken out?) 
Our group will work together to implement the following game for project one. The user will attempt to reach the other side of the screen in order to complete the level. The user is given a limited amount of attempts in order to complete the level. 
The computer will "send" objects into the users path, if the user hits an object they must restart, once the allotted amount of attempts have been used up, the user has lost the game and must re-start. The levels will 
get consistently harder to complete, as the computer will send more and more objects into the users path, traveling at various speeds. The game will store the users scores from each attempt and display them on the leaderboard. 
The highest of all of the scores will be considered the "high score".


Stage one 

1. It is done when on the starting page there there is a JS prompt for the user to input their username.
2. It is done when there is a circle (the user) that can move up the screen and squares (objects in the way) that go
horizontally accross the screen.
3. It is done when there is a header at the top of the game denoting what level the user is on. 

Stage two 

1. it is done when there is a prompt explaining how the game works, and the user can click through the steps
2. it is done when there is a button for the user to click to input their username
3. it is done when there are at least 5 levels for the user to complete
4. it is done when the computer can log each score and determine the highest score.

Stage three 

1. it is done when there is a css sheet that formats the background of the game
2. it is done when there is an avatar that represents the user
3. it is done when there are cars that represent the obstacles on level one
4. it is done when there are stationary potholes that represent obstacles for the user to navigate
5. it is done when on the left side of the screen there is a leaderboard that shows the previous scores
